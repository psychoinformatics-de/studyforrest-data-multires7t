description: |
  "Extension of the dataset published in Hanke et al. (2014; doi:10.1038/sdata.2014.3) with
   additional acquisitions for 6 of the original 20 participants (and one additional participant).
   Participants performed a central fixation task while being stimulated with oriented gratings.
   The experiment was repeated in four different sessions with 7T BOLD fMRI acquisition, each
   with a different scan resolution (0.8, 1.4, 2.0, and 3.0 mm).
   
   This research was supported by a grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG) awarded to
   S. Pollmann and O. Speck (DFG PO 548/15-1). This research was, in part, also supported by the
   German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of a US-German collaboration
   in computational neuroscience (CRCNS), co-funded by the BMBF and the US National Science
   Foundation (BMBF 01GQ1112; NSF 1129855). Work on the data-sharing technology employed for this
   research was supported by US-German CRCNS project, co-funded by the BMBF and the US National
   Science Foundation (BMBF 01GQ1411; NSF 1429999).""
